## What this project is

**Wand of Saves** — a Material 3 desktop application that opens a Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition
save, edits the party (stats, inventory, spells, effects, journal, variables, appearance), and
writes it back safely.

*The name is a D&D pun: a wand for saving throws, and for save games.* The format package is
`infinity_formats`, after the **Infinity Engine** — the BioWare engine behind Baldur's Gate,
Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment.

It is a **functional successor to EE Keeper**, not a port of it. EE Keeper is a 2017 Win32/MFC
application; this is a new Flutter application. The *feature set* is the target; the UI and the
architecture are deliberately different:

| | EE Keeper | This project |
|---|---|---|
| UI | Win32/MFC, MDI, 31 modal dialogs | Material 3, adaptive desktop layout |
| Architecture | MFC Document/View (MVC-ish) | Flutter **MVVM** (`context/mvvm-architecture-record.md`) |
| State | one 11,848-byte mutable `CEEKeeperDoc` | immutable domain model + edit commands (gives undo/redo) |

**v1 scope is BG1EE only** — `GAM V2.0` + `CRE V1.0`. That is a deliberate decision (D3); it drops
IWDEE's `CRE V9.0`, IWD2's `V2.2`, PST's field set and the alternate item-slot layouts. Keep codec
*dispatch* pluggable (selected by the version signature) even though only one implementation
exists — sealing the layout into a single hardcoded reader is the one shortcut that is expensive
to undo.

## Read this first, in order

1. `planning/decisions.md` — **D1 (licensing) is closed: Apache-2.0, and it constrains how you
   may work.** Read its "constraint this imposes" section before writing any codec.
2. `planning/using-nearinfinity.md` — **what you may and may not do with the Java.** Short, and
   it answers the question D1 raises. Read it before the first codec.
3. `planning/architecture.md` — layering, package split, folder layout, the provider graph.
4. `docs/findings/verified-format-offsets.md` — the format facts already established and
   **verified against real save data**. Do not re-derive these.
5. `docs/findings/eekeeper-reverse-engineering.md` — what EE Keeper actually does, recovered from
   the binary. This is the feature checklist.
6. `context/` — the pinned target-side canon (Flutter AI rules, Effective Dart, MVVM record,
   Java semantics ledger, **Dart data-modelling ledger**). Where code disagrees with `context/`,
   that is a defect or a recorded deviation, not a preference. Deviations recorded so far:
   D2, D6, D7, D8, D9.

## Hard rules

- **All reference material is read-only.** Never modify anything under `../NearInfinity`,
  `../iesdp`, `../EEKeeper`, the Steam game install, or the user's saves.
  See `reference/README.md`.
- **Never edit a real save in place.** Always write to a temp file and rename, and always keep a
  `.bak`. Test fixtures are *copies*; the originals under
  `~/.local/share/Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition/save/` are the user's actual game.
- **Dart/Flutter are NOT on PATH** — use `fvm flutter …` / `fvm dart …`. SDK pinned to 3.44.8
  in `.fvmrc`.
- **`packages/infinity_formats` must never import `package:flutter`.** It is pure Dart so its suite runs
  under `dart test`, which makes the rule mechanical: a Flutter import fails to compile there and
  names the file. `packages/infinity_formats/dart_test.yaml` pins `platforms: [vm]` to keep that true,
  and `test/flutter_free_test.dart` walks every source file so the rule covers code no test has
  reached yet.
- **State management is Riverpod 3.x with manually declared providers — NO code generation
  *for Riverpod*** (D2). No `@riverpod` annotations, no `*.g.dart`. This is a *declared
  deviation* from `context/flutter-ai-rules.md`'s native-first default; everywhere else, a
  disagreement with `context/` is still a defect. See `planning/architecture.md` §The provider
  graph.
- **Code generation is decided per dependency** (D9). D2's denial covers Riverpod, not the
  project — it has already been misread as a blanket ban. Serialization and data classes use
  **`dart_mappable`**, which brings `build_runner` in with it when the first domain model lands
  in Phase 2.
- **Lint is `very_good_analysis`, applied whole, with NO suppressions** (D8). No `exclude:`
  entries, no rule carve-outs, no `// ignore` or `// ignore_for_file` anywhere. This is
  checkable, so check it:
  `grep -rn 'ignore_for_file\|// ignore:' --include='*.dart' .` must return nothing. If a rule
  is unsatisfiable, fix the code or reopen D8 — do not silence it.
- **Round-trip byte identity is the gate for every writer.** Read a real file, write it back with
  no edits, compare bytes. A writer without a passing round-trip test is not done.
- **Preserve unknown bytes.** GAM and CRE contain unused and undocumented regions. Parse into a
  model *and keep the original bytes*; on save, patch known fields into a copy of the original.
  A model that re-serialises only the fields it understands silently destroys the rest.
- **Licensing: Apache-2.0, and codec work is INDEPENDENT IMPLEMENTATION** — written from public
  documentation and verified against a black-box oracle. (Not *clean-room*: that term means two
  isolated teams, which is not the process here.) This is the rule most likely to be broken by
  accident, so it is stated plainly: **do not read NearInfinity's Java while writing codec code** — not as a template, not to check an algorithm, not for "how did they structure
  this". Apache-2.0 cannot incorporate or derive from LGPL-2.1. Instead:
    - **IESDP** (`../iesdp`) is the specification source. It documents every format
      this project needs.
    - **NearInfinity is a black-box oracle** — run it, compare its output to yours. Executing a
      program creates no derivative work, so this is unrestricted and is the intended use.
    - **Shadow Keeper is off-limits entirely.**
  Every source file carries the Apache header (below). Facts flow freely; expression does not.
  **Full guidance, including the oracle's own licensing boundary:
  `planning/using-nearinfinity.md`.**

- **Apache header on every source file:**

## Build & run

```bash
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter run -d linux        # primary dev target
fvm flutter analyze             # currently clean; keep it that way
fvm dart run tool/spike/gam_cre_tlk_spike.dart   # the working read-path spike

# The infinity_formats suite is a separate package and runs from its own directory.
# `fvm dart test` at the repo root finds nothing and prints usage.
cd packages/infinity_formats && fvm dart test
```

**There is no CI** — deliberately (solo project, one machine). Nothing enforces the checks above,
so run them yourself before committing: `analyze`, `dart format`, and the `infinity_formats` suite.
Consequence to keep in mind: **`macos/` and `windows/` are never built by anything**, so breakage
there will surface only when someone first tries to build on those platforms.

**Platforms: desktop only** — `linux/`, `macos/`, `windows/`. No web, no mobile, deliberately: this
app reads a local game installation and writes to local save files, which is not a sandboxed-mobile
or browser workload. Development happens on Linux; macOS and Windows are scaffolded but unverified.

**Dependencies are kept at latest.** The project was created and then immediately brought up to
date with `fvm flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Prefer current versions over pinning. Note
that `matcher`, `meta`, `test_api` and `vector_math` will always report as outdated in the app —
they are pinned by `flutter_test` from the SDK and cannot be upgraded independently. That is
expected, not a problem to fix.

## Current stage

**Phase 0, in progress.** The first codec has landed; the groundwork below it is complete:

- ✅ Flutter scaffold (`flutter create --empty --platforms=linux,macos,windows`), SDK pinned,
  dependencies brought to latest with `pub upgrade --major-versions`.
- ✅ Apache-2.0 adopted (D1), `LICENSE` + `NOTICE` in place.
- ✅ Riverpod 3.x wired, no code generation (D2); `ProviderScope` wraps the app.
- ✅ Target-side canon carried over in `context/`.
- ✅ EE Keeper reverse-engineered; feature set and UI spec extracted
  (`docs/findings/eekeeper-ui-spec.json`, 72 dialogs / 927 controls / 173 classes —
  structure only; proprietary prose deliberately redacted, do not re-add).
- ✅ Format offsets for `GAM V2.0` and `CRE V1.0` verified against a real save.
- ✅ **A working read-path spike** — `tool/spike/gam_cre_tlk_spike.dart` parses
  GAM → party → embedded CRE → `dialog.tlk` in ~120 lines of pure Dart, and runs today.
- ✅ **`Tlk` shipped** — `packages/infinity_formats/lib/src/tlk/`, written test-first, 20 tests
  passing. 16 are hermetic (built against synthetic in-test fixtures, so they run on a fresh
  clone with no game installed); 4 confirm documented values against the real `dialog.tlk` and
  skip when it is absent. `InfinityFormatException` lives alongside it.
- ✅ **Fixture harness + `FormatField` + `GamCodec` header read/write.** `tool/dev/sync_fixtures.dart`
  copies real saves into a gitignored fixture directory; format layouts are enhanced enums with a
  reusable layout invariant; `Gam` keeps the source bytes as an unmodifiable view and edits patch a
  copy.
- ✅ **The write path is proven in-game** (2026-08-07) — party gold edited on a real save, 2 bytes
  changed out of 95,968, loads in BG:EE showing the new value. See
  `docs/findings/verified-format-offsets.md` §Write path. **It proves the mechanism, not offset
  recalculation** — nothing resized.
- ⬅️ **Here: the rest of Phase 0** — the GAM party/non-party NPC structs, then `CreCodec`.
  **Four known bugs in the spike must be fixed properly rather than papered over** — see
  `docs/findings/verified-format-offsets.md` §Known bugs.

⚠️ **TLK strings are UTF-8, not cp1252.** Earlier notes throughout this repo said cp1252; that was
falsified against the shipped game data on 2026-08-07 and is corrected everywhere. cp1252 is real
for the *classic* engine, which D3 puts out of scope.

`lib/` is still Flutter's empty stub and is expected to be replaced. The MVVM folder layout and
the provider graph come from `planning/architecture.md`, not from improvisation on the scaffold.

See `planning/roadmap.md` for Phases 1–7.

## A warning about this domain

This application writes to files that represent tens of hours of someone's play. The failure mode
is not a crash — it is a save that loads and is subtly wrong, or does not load at all. Two specific
hazards, both already observed:

1. **Never infer a size or a stride from the difference between two offsets.** An offset field of
   `0` means the section is **absent**, not that it sits at the start of the file — all three
   BG1EE fixtures carry `partyInventoryOffset = 0`, which is exactly how the spike computed a
   stride of **−180**. Read the documented struct size: the GAM party NPC struct is **352 bytes**,
   verified three ways in `docs/findings/verified-format-offsets.md`.
2. **Editing changes sizes.** A CRE that grows moves every subsequent offset in the GAM, and the
   same applies inside CRE itself (known spells, memorisation, item slots, effects each carry
   offset+count headers). Offset recalculation on write is where save corruption comes from.

Prefer verifying against an oracle over reasoning from a spec. See
`docs/findings/verified-format-offsets.md` §Oracles.
